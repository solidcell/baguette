/// `HingeMotor` — and `DeviceKeys` — that keeps `HingeControl serve`
/// running inside the guest (`xcrun simctl spawn <udid> <HingeControl>
/// --deadline <t> serve`) and writes each command to it: `sweep <from>
/// <to> <ms>`, `orientation <native-value>`, `button <page> <usage> <ms>`.
///
/// The tool registers a HID service shaped like dtuhidd's `avpCustom`
/// and dispatches the pose events Device Hub sends (see
/// `Injected/HingeControl/Sources/HingeControl.m`); the runtime folds,
/// SpringBoard swaps panels, and `DevicectlHinge` reads the sweep back
/// like any other. Kept rather than spawned per command: a spawn is most
/// of a second, and the service stays registered between poses. Commands
/// are played one at a time — a pick during a sweep queues behind it.
///
/// The tool answers each command with `done <status>` once played, so a
/// call returns when the guest has acted and a one-shot CLI cannot exit
/// with its command still queued. A command not answered within the
/// allowance stops the tool: its guest process is killed by the pid it
/// printed at startup, and a tool that had not started refuses to act past
/// its `--deadline`. A timeout therefore means the command was delivered
/// before the deadline or never will be.
///
/// The orchestration — tool lookup, argv, the write, the answer, stopping
/// and restarting the tool — is unit-covered through `MockSubprocess`;
/// `HostSubprocess` is integration-only.
