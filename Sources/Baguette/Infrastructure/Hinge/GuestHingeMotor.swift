/// `HingeMotor` — and `DeviceKeys` — that keeps `HingeControl serve`
/// running inside the guest (`xcrun simctl spawn <udid> <HingeControl>
/// serve`) and writes each command to it: `sweep <from> <to> <ms>`,
/// `button <page> <usage> <ms>`. Rotation uses a bounded one-shot child.
///
/// The tool registers a HID service shaped like dtuhidd's `avpCustom`
/// and dispatches the pose events Device Hub sends (see
/// `Injected/HingeControl/Sources/HingeControl.m`); the runtime folds,
/// SpringBoard swaps panels, and `DevicectlHinge` reads the sweep back
/// like any other. Kept rather than spawned per sweep: a spawn is most
/// of a second, and the service stays registered between poses. Sweeps
/// are played one at a time — a pick during a sweep queues behind it —
/// and the call returns once the sweep has had its time.
///
/// The orchestration — tool lookup, argv, the write, restart after
/// exit — is unit-covered through `MockSubprocess`; `HostSubprocess`
/// is integration-only.
