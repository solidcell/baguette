# Hinge (iPhone Duo)

iPhone Duo folds. `baguette hinge` moves its hinge — Device Hub's pose
picker from the CLI, the HTTP route and the page — and reads it back.
Every flag: [commands.md#baguette-hinge](../../commands.md#baguette-hinge).

## Quick start

```bash
baguette hinge --udid <UDID>                    # {"ok":true,"angleDegrees":130.0}
baguette hinge --udid <UDID> --pose closed      # 0°   sweeps over 0.8 s
baguette hinge --udid <UDID> --pose open        # 130° Device Hub's book pose
baguette hinge --udid <UDID> --pose flat        # 180°
baguette hinge --udid <UDID> --angle 95 --duration 1.2
```

On the `serve` page, the pose picker under a booted Duo offers closed,
open and flat, beside a hinge slider (see
[iPhone Duo](../iphone-duo/README.md)). SpringBoard swaps panels as the
hinge moves, and the page, the lit panel and the chrome all follow.

## HTTP / WebSocket

```http
POST /simulators/<udid>/hinge?pose=open
POST /simulators/<udid>/hinge?angle=95&duration=1.2
GET  /simulators/<udid>/hinge
```

The `POST` blocks for the sweep and answers `{"ok":true}`; `400` for a
pose that is not `closed`/`open`/`flat`, an angle off 0–180 or a
negative duration; `404` for an unknown udid; `500` when the device
could not be driven (no `HingeControl` shipped, guest refused). A phone
answers the `GET` with `foldable:false` and has nothing to drive.

On the 3D socket the picker sends:

```json
{"type":"set_pose","hingeDegrees":130}
```

and the book follows the hinge samples as the device folds, panels
swapping under it exactly as when Device Hub does it.

The other way, a foldable's stream socket (`/simulators/<UDID>/stream`)
sends every sample the hinge sweeps through, so a page can draw the fold
at the device's angle:

```json
{"type":"hinge","angleDegrees":130.0}
```

## Rotation

```bash
baguette orientation --udid <UDID> portrait
baguette orientation --udid <UDID> portrait-upside-down
baguette orientation --udid <UDID> landscape-left
baguette orientation --udid <UDID> landscape-right
```

Duo uses the guest pose channel for physical rotation; the legacy orientation
message does not rotate it. Single-panel devices keep the legacy path. The
public command and HTTP orientation route select the same backend. The app
still controls its interface orientation, and the inner display's axes differ
from the physical device's axes; command success establishes dispatch, not a
particular app layout.

Rotation waits for a one-shot guest command to complete, with an eight-second
limit. Missing helpers, failed exits and emitted diagnostics report failure;
there is no fallback to the ignored legacy event on a foldable.

## Hardware keys

On iPhone Duo the legacy button press is ignored by SpringBoard, so
baguette presses a foldable's volume, power / lock, and action keys
through the same guest-side route Device Hub uses. `baguette press`,
`POST …/input` and the page's buttons work unchanged; `home` and the
edge gestures still take the legacy path. Single-panel devices are
untouched.

## Gotchas

- Device Hub and baguette both feed the same hinge; whoever sent last
  wins, and Device Hub's picker shows its own last pick, not the
  device's angle, until it next reads the hinge.
- `HingeControl` needs the iOS 27.1 simulator's private `HID.framework`
  to accept a virtual service from an unentitled process, which it does;
  a future runtime may not.
- The guest's hinge stream (`devicectl`) can go silent after a
  SpringBoard restart (`baguette heal`); driving still works, reading
  it back resumes once Device Hub or baguette moves the pose again.
- Sweeps queue behind one another. The first pose spawns the guest
  helper; later ones cost no spawn (~0.9 s round trip for Device Hub's
  0.8 s sweep).
